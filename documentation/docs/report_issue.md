# Report an issue

Whenever you write a bug report, it's incredibly helpful to include debug logs directly. Otherwise, we'll need to request them separately, prolonging the process. Please enable debug logs as shown and include them in your issue:


### Enable from the UI
Via UI (1)
`Reload integration after enabling the debug from the UI`
{.annotate}

### Enable from Configuration file 
Configuration.yaml file `Recommended` <br>
Add the below line into your `configuration.yaml` that located in HA config directory. <br>

!!! note 
    Editing the `configuration` file will require an HA restart to apply the changes.

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.localtuya: debug
    custom_components.localtuyax.pytuya: debug
```

### Enable device debug.
Then, edit the device that is showing problems and check the `Enable debugging for this device` (1)
